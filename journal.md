## **5/25/2025 Log 1: Project Goals and initial BOM**

To start this off, I decided upon a couple design goals for this project. The main reason I'm doing this is just to see if I can and because the [canteliever style](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ux0-xS0A1uI) is very interesting. Taking advantage of this style, here are my goals:

- Small 120 x 120mm build volume to make the printer easy to fit in to any space
- No extrusion, use the rails as the frame
- Make it a "corner" so it can sit cleanly in a corner of a wall and be completely functional
- XY at the top, moving Z 
- Affordable, reasonably high quality, reasonably fast (I'm coming from an Ender 3 so not expecting much)

As usual, I made my [Onshape document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/23b4e50d6c05fcb813eea4aa/w/7fe1f2bc9a8fa9069679c050/e/448736e2902a950e6c5dd058?renderMode=0&uiState=687e405897e37c02a58bec0e) and a starter [BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wA5AeRHLFUGY_Gqp5uV-WRdiVc_ecCNHqM5kMq4zwS4/edit?usp=sharing) to see if this is possible. I'm using a fellow [Hack Club contributors BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1phz7-RffRIvpMKJ_e924fQqCT83ikvXl2FwaxxTpVO4/edit?usp=sharing) as a starting point, since I've never built a printer before. Also, since I'm still waiting for approval on my other project, I haven't made an Aliexpress account and see all the welcome deal prices, so I'm currently marking them as full price but expecting the project to be much cheaper. Even then, I have most components selected and am still under $300 for the printer, which is pretty impressive to me.

I began by putting together the BOM as best I could, finding some 3D models for my linear rails, motors, and controller, and started a rough model which I will continue later. This was mostly about getting that BOM together to figure out how much I need to do and how much it'll cost.
